Holy moly, because the class's average was super low on the test, the teacher just added a curve for the test grades! ðŸ˜­

Create a grades.py program that checks whether a grade is above or below 55.

Start by creating a variable called grade and give it a value between 0-100.

Write a if/else statement for the following:

If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed."
Else, print "You failed."











grade = int (input("What is ypur grade?"))

if grade >= 55:
  print("You Passed!")
else:
  print("Failed!")
